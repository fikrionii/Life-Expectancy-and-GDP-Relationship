# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Relationship
This project will investigates the effect of socioeconomic development using GDP on life expectancy in six countries (Chile, China , Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe).

## Project Goals
Life Expectancy refers to the number of years a person can expect to live, based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die. Life expectancy is a measure that is often used to gauge overall health of a country.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all finished goods and service made within a country during a specific period. GDP provides an economic snapshot of a country and used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate.

This project will analyze GDP and life expectancy variable of a country and answer the following questions:
- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- What is the average life expectancy of these nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?

## Data Overview

For this project, GDP data is obtained from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) and life expectancy data is obtained from [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688).

The dataset consist of 4 columns:
- `Country` : Country of observation
- `Year` : Year of observation
- `Life Expectancy at birth (years)` : The average number of years that a newborn could expect to live
- `GDP` : Gross Domestic Product of the country (in USD)

## Insight from Data:
Through working on this dataset, we've found some interesting conclusions:
1. Life expectancy at birth increased over time in all 6 countries, with Zimbabwe having the largest increase.
2. GDP has increased over time as well, especially for China.
3. Average life expectancy is between mid to high 70s, except for Zimbabwe which is 50 years.
4. There is a strong positive relationship between GDP and life expectancy, with all countries has coefficient > 0.9.
