# Life-Expectancy-and-GDP-Relationship
This project will investigates the effect of socioeconomic development using GDP on life expectancy in six countries (Chile, China , Germany, Mexico, United States of America, and Zimbabwe).

## Project Goals
Life Expectancy refers to the number of years a person can expect to live, based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die. Life expectancy is a measure that is often used to gauge overall health of a country.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value of all finished goods and service made within a country during a specific period. GDP provides an economic snapshot of a country and used to estimate the size of an economy and growth rate.

This project will analyze GDP and life expectancy variable of a country and answer the following questions:
- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- What is the average life expectancy of these nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?

## Data Overview

For this project, GDP data is obtained from [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) and life expectancy data is obtained from [WHO](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)

The dataset consist of 4 columns:
Country : Country of observation
Year : Year of observation
Life Expectancy at birth (years)  Life expectancy in age
GDP | Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
